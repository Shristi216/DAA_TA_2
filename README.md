The SUBSET-SUM problem involves determining whether or not a subset from a list of integers can sum to a target value. 

For example, if we consider the list of nums = [1, 2, 3, 4] . If the target = 7 , then there are two subsets that achieve this sum: {3, 4} and {1, 2, 4} 

Applications of subset-sum-problem:

[1]Totaling the money for buying a movie ticket

[2]Computer passwords

Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information.

The computer generates a large number (say 500) of $a_i$. They are stored in the internal file. A password is a subset of $\{1,\dots,500\}$. (in practice, there is a program to convert a normal sequence-of-symbols password to such a subset.) Instead of having the password for the user, the computer keeps the total associated with the appropriate subset. When the user types in the subset, the computer tests whether the total is correct. It does not keep a record of the subset. Thus impersonation is possible only if somebody can reconstruct the subset knowing the $a_i$ and the total.
